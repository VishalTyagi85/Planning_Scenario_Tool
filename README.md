# Planning Scenario Tool

## Project Overview
The **Planning Scenario Tool** is designed to help businesses or individuals plan and evaluate different scenarios for sales, profit, and margin analysis. This tool allows users to adjust parameters such as discount percentages, sales units, and cost of goods sold (COGS) to simulate financial outcomes, allowing for a clear understanding of potential scenarios, including best, realistic, and worst-case scenarios. This scenario planning helps businesses optimize their strategies to reach or exceed gross margin targets.

## Key Features
- **Scenario Planning**: Simulate sales, revenue, and gross margin based on different discount percentages, sales projections, and cost of goods sold (COGS).
- **Financial Evaluation**: Calculate net sales, post-discount revenue, COGS, and gross margin for each scenario.
- **Gross Margin Targeting**: Evaluate performance against a predefined gross margin target to make data-driven decisions.
- **Excel-Based Tool**: The tool utilizes Excel for easy tracking and modification of key business metrics.

## Files in the Repository
1. **Planning Scenario Tool.pdf**: A PDF version of the Excel report that showcases the calculations and results based on different scenario inputs (Best Case, Realistic Case, and Worst Case).
2. **Planning Scenario Tool.xlsx**: The main Excel tool where all data is entered, and calculations for sales, net sales, post-discount, COGS, and gross margin are done.
3. **Video Representation.mp4**: A video that demonstrates the functionality of the Planning Scenario Tool, explaining how to use the tool and the calculations involved.

## How to Use the Tool
1. **Open the Excel File**:
   - The Excel file (`Planning Scenario Tool.xlsx`) contains pre-configured cells where you can input parameters like discount percentage, sales units, and cost of goods sold.
   - It will automatically calculate key metrics like net sales, post-discount sales, COGS, and gross margin for different scenarios.

2. **Adjust Parameters**:
   - Modify the discount percentage, sales units, or other values to simulate different financial scenarios (Best Case, Realistic Case, Worst Case).

3. **Analyze the Results**:
   - The tool will output the net sales, gross margin, and performance against your target gross margin.
   - Use these results to make informed business decisions, such as adjusting pricing strategies or assessing financial risks.
